    your overall health and well-being.

    What your BMI result means
  
    A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a 
    healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, 
    such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced 
    fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, 
    strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for 
    five days a week.
  


  
   
  

   
  
    Limitations of BMI
  
    Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for 
    every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in 
    certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.
